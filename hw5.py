'''
In this program BACKWARD CHAIN algorithm is implemented.

Until all hypotheses have been tried and none have been supported or until the
animal is identified program does the following for each hypotheses:

For each rule whose consequent matches the current hypothesis,

Try to support each of the rule's antecedents by matching it to assertions in working
memory or by backward chaining through another rule, creating new hypotheses. Program checks
all matching and instantiation alternatives.

If all the rule's antecedents are supported, program announces success and its concludes
that the hypothesis is true.

Our program follows the following rules, which are taken from ZOOKEEPER in WINSTON 

Z1      If   ?x has hair
        then ?x is a mammal

Z2      If   ?x gives milk 
        then ?x is a mammal

Z3      If   ?x has feathers 
        then ?x is a bird
   
Z4      If   ?x flies 
             ?x lays eggs
        then ?x is a bird
        
Z5      If   ?x is a mammal 
             ?x eats meat
        then ?x is a carnivore

Z6      If   ?x is a mammal 
             ?x has pointed teeth
             ?x has claws
             ?x has forward-pointing eyes
        then ?x is a carnivore

Z7      If   ?x is a mammal 
             ?x has hoofs
        then ?x is an ungulate
        
Z8      If   ?x is a mammal 
             ?x chews cud
        then ?x is an ungulate
        
Z9      If   ?x is a carnivore 
             ?x has tawny color
             ?x has dark spots
        then ?x is a cheetah
        
Z10     If   ?x is a carnivore 
             ?x has tawny color
             ?x has black strips
        then ?x is a tiger
        
Z11     If   ?x is a ungulate 
             ?x has long legs
             ?x has long neck
             ?x has tawny color
             ?x has dark spots
        then ?x is a giraffe
        
Z12     If   ?x is a ungulate 
             ?x has white color
             ?x has black stripes
        then ?x is a zebra

Z13     If   ?x is a bird 
             ?x does not fly
             ?x has long legs
             ?x has long neck
             ?x is black and white
        then ?x is an ostrich
        
Z14     If   ?x is a bird
             ?x does not fly
             ?x swims
             ?x is black and white
        then ?x is a penguin
        
Z15     If   ?x is a bird
             ?x is a good flyer
        then ?x is a albatross
